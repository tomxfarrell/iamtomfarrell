              About Me
            </h2>
            <p>I'm a front-end developer with over 2 decades of experience developing custom websites and interactive animations. I can be described as analytical and detail-oriented with a creative eye and ability to build websites from concept to completion. I also have years of Pharma and healthcare agency experience working with cross functional teams and utilizing agile methodologies. I guess you can say, the difference of working with me is like night and day.</p>
